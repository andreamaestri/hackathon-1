### Reflections & Acceptance Criteria

#### Must Haves

- **Card-like Section**: 

1. Card Layout and Structure

* Each card should have a consistent structure (e.g., title, data/value, description, and optional action buttons).
* Cards should be clearly separated visually, with borders or shadows to distinguish them from one another.
* The cards should automatically adjust their layout based on screen size:
* On web (desktop): Cards should be arranged in a grid format, making use of the available space.
* On mobile: Cards should stack vertically and resize to fit smaller screens.

2. Responsive Design

* The card section should be responsive, with cards resizing and rearranging depending on the screen size and device.
* Cards should maintain readable font sizes and clear visuals on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens.
* On mobile, users should not need to zoom in or excessively scroll horizontally to view a full card.

3. Loading and Performance

* Cards should load within 2 seconds, even when multiple cards are being displayed.
* If data for the cards is being fetched from an API, there should be a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner or skeleton card) to signal that the data is being retrieved.
* The section should be optimised for fast performance, even with a large number of cards, ensuring smooth scrolling and minimal load times.

#### Should Have
- **Real-Time Price Updates:**: Implement a system to fetch and display energy prices every half hour, ensuring users have the latest information.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:**: An intuitive dashboard that visualizes energy prices, trends, and recommended times for usage.
- **Notification System:**: A feature that allows users to set alerts for when prices drop below a specified level.
- **Data Visualization:**: Include graphs or charts that show historical price data and forecast trends to help users make informed decisions.

#### Could Have
- **Weather Integration: **: Incorporated weather data to help users understand how weather conditions might affect energy prices and consumption.
- **Carbon Footprint Calculator:**: A tool that estimates users carbon footprint based on their energy consumption, promoting eco-friendly habits.
- **Integration with Smart Devices:**: Users can connect smart home devices to automate energy usage based on price alerts.
- **Community Features:**: Add a forum or discussion section where users can share tips and experiences related to energy savings.
